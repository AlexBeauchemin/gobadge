#### ðŸ‘† Easily create and insert coverage badge (or any other badge) in your readme with go

Using [https://shields.io](https://shields.io), the executable will generate a coverage badge based on the coverage output. The badge will be inserted on the second line of the readme if it doesn't exist, and will be updated if already present.

## How to use
Install the executable
```
go get github.com/AlexBeauchemin/gobadge
go install github.com/AlexBeauchemin/gobadge
```
Make sure you generate a coverage file with your total coverage, something like
```go
go test ./... -covermode=count -coverprofile=coverage.out fmt
go tool cover -func=coverage.out -o=coverage.out
```

Your output should looks like this, with the total as the last line
```
...
github.com/AlexBeauchemin/go-coverage-badge/gobadge.go:36:	retrieveTotalCoverage	87.5%
github.com/AlexBeauchemin/go-coverage-badge/gobadge.go:53:	updateReadme		80.0%
total:								(statements)		67.4%
```
Then run the executable
```
gobadge -filename=coverage.out
```

- Allow to specify a line number in the target file for badge creation
- Allow to specify a template to look for in the target file for badge creation
